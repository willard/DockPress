# dockepress
A pretty simplified Docker Compose workflow that sets up a LEMP network of containers for local WordPress development.


## Usage

To get started, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) on your system, and then clone this repository.

Next, navigate in your terminal to the directory you cloned this, and spin up the containers for the web server by running `docker-compose up -d --build site`.

Bringing up the Docker Compose network with `site` instead of just using `up`, ensures that only our site's containers are brought up at the start, instead of all of the command containers as well. The following are built for our web server, with their exposed ports detailed:

- **nginx** - `:8080`
- **mysql** - `:3306`
- **php** - `:9001`

add wordpress files to wordpress empty folder, edit the .env for database credentials

Navigate to localhost:8080
